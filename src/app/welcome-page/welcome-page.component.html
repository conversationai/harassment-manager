        How does Clap Back work?
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>Clap Back syncs with the user’s Twitter account and uses machine learning technology to identify abusive
      comments,
      providing toxicity scores and enabling the user to take action - through muting or blocking accounts in bulk -
      without
      reviewing the content. Users have the ability to unhide the comments if they wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users also have the option to create records of harassment and download a report, which can be shared with trusted
      third
      parties as needed. Users can choose to include all the abusive content and accounts that the tool has identified
      as
      being harmful, or customise their selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abusive accounts will not know that they have been featured in a report and no third party - including Code for
      Africa,
      Twitter and Jigsaw - will access the report generated in the tool. Draft reports are temporarily stored in the
      tool to
      enable you to complete them. Once downloaded or abandoned, the report will be deleted from Clap Back.
